# Online Exam System using MERN Stack

The Online Exam System is a web-based application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. This system enables the hosting of objective answer-type exams, provides secure authentication for individuals and administrators, offers session-based access, and features a responsive frontend developed using React.js and Bootstrap.



## Features

- **Exam Hosting:** The system allows the creation and hosting of exams with objective answer-type questions, such as multiple-choice questions.

- **Authentication:** Passport.js has been integrated to ensure secure authentication for both individual exam takers and administrators. This maintains the integrity of the exam process.

- **Session-Based Access:** The use of `express-session` ensures that once users are authenticated, they can access various sections of the application without repeated login during their session.

- **Frontend:** The frontend is designed using React.js, utilizing the power of `react-redux`, `redux-persist`, and `redux-router` for efficient state management, persistence, and routing.

- **Responsive Design:** The application is built with a responsive web design approach using Bootstrap, ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices and screen sizes.
